binfmt-support 2.1.5 (24 August 2014)
=====================================

Add an "update-binfmts --preserve yes" option, mapping to the 'P' flag in
Linux binfmt_misc's flags field.  Thanks to Riku Voipio.

binfmt-support 2.1.4 (30 March 2014)
====================================

Fix test suite when libexecdir is not /usr/lib.

Fix --disable-sysvinit and --disable-openrc configure options.

Make the Upstart job a service with pre-start and post-stop stanzas rather
than a task, as a task with a corresponding init script prevents startpar
from continuing the boot sequence past that init script (because the job is
considered "stopped").  Thanks to Cameron Norman.

binfmt-support 2.1.3 (8 February 2014)
======================================

Fix reversed logic in OpenRC script.

binfmt-support 2.1.2 (7 February 2014)
======================================

Stop hardcoding Debian defaults for various directories.

Ensure all necessary directories exist after installation.

Embed full path to update-binfmts into the sample sysvinit script and the
Upstart job file (the systemd unit file already did this), to save a path
lookup.

Add OpenRC support.

Add mutually-exclusive --enable-sysvinit and --enable-openrc configure
options, which cause the sysvinit or OpenRC script respectively to be
installed to $sysconfdir/init.d/binfmt-support.

binfmt-support 2.1.1 (29 December 2013)
=======================================

Fix installation of systemd unit files.

binfmt-support 2.1.0 (29 December 2013)
=======================================

First separate upstream release, based on previous versions in Debian.

Add a systemd unit file.
