binfmt-support (1.2.18) unstable; urgency=low

  * Convert to source format 3.0 (native).
  * Only warn about corrupted files in /var/lib/binfmts/ when we can't
    continue without their contents (LP: #547052).

binfmt-support (1.2.17) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Exit cleanly on non-Linux systems, rather than causing inconvenient
    knock-on errors (closes: #565109).

  [ Lo√Øc Minier ]
  * Add a new optional field "credentials" which when set to "yes"
    corresponds to the binfmt-misc "C" flag; this allows running setuid root
    binaries with the interpreter; LP: #519228.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Wed, 17 Feb 2010 14:06:05 +0000

binfmt-support (1.2.16) unstable; urgency=low

  * Check whether modprobe is available before using it, this time in the
    init script too (closes: #567979).

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Mon, 01 Feb 2010 17:40:51 +0000

binfmt-support (1.2.15) unstable; urgency=low

  * Ignore modprobe failures in init script (thanks, Philipp Weis; closes:
    #549113).

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Thu, 01 Oct 2009 19:18:10 +0100

binfmt-support (1.2.14) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Tormod Volden ]
  * Maintain a cache of binary format registration instructions, and use
    them from shell at boot time if possible to avoid the Perl slow path
    (LP: #320822).

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Tue, 15 Sep 2009 12:48:37 +0100

binfmt-support (1.2.13) unstable; urgency=low

  * Upgrade to debhelper 7. Uses override targets, so requires 7.0.50.
  * Check that /etc/default/rcS exists before sourcing it.
  * Stop hardcoding path to update-binfmts.
  * Remove Default-Stop from init script; cf. changelog entry for 1.2.8.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Mon, 07 Sep 2009 02:19:38 +0100

binfmt-support (1.2.12) unstable; urgency=low

  * Moved to bzr.debian.org; add Vcs-Bzr control field.
  * Some packages (hi, mono) occasionally seem to try to remove formats that
    weren't installed and thus don't have an entry in the administration
    directory. Make this non-fatal, since the state is already as requested.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Tue, 26 May 2009 10:13:28 +0100

binfmt-support (1.2.11) unstable; urgency=low

  * Recommend POSIX-compliant shell fragments in README.Debian.
  * Remove stray 'closedir ADMINDIR' in act_display (closes: #482482).

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Fri, 23 May 2008 09:20:19 +0100

binfmt-support (1.2.10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix brown-paper-bag syntax error in Binfmt::Format (thanks, Bastian
    Kleineidam; closes: #418343).
  * Suppress perl warning about commas within qw().

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Mon, 09 Apr 2007 18:49:57 +0100

binfmt-support (1.2.9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Mount /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc nodev, noexec, and nosuid, to guard
    against possible future kernel security vulnerabilities.
  * Suppress warning on --test --import if the given format file has no
    detector line (closes: #383287).

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Sun, 08 Apr 2007 21:32:00 +0100

binfmt-support (1.2.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Disabling binfmt-support on system shutdown is rather pointless, so stop
    doing it.
  * Move debhelper from Build-Depends-Indep to Build-Depends (for clean
    target).
  * Use debhelper v4.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Tue,  2 May 2006 23:27:09 +0100

binfmt-support (1.2.7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Remove outdated skeleton comments in init script, since there's very
    little of the skeleton left.
  * Add LSB info to init script.
  * Use log_daemon_msg from lsb-base (>= 3.0-6) for more policy-compliant
    init script output.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Thu, 27 Oct 2005 13:17:31 +0100

binfmt-support (1.2.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Mount binfmt_misc filesystem as 'binfmt_misc' rather than 'none'
    (thanks, Roucaries Bastien; closes: #328827).

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Sat, 17 Sep 2005 17:18:38 +0100

binfmt-support (1.2.5) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Stop the postinst/prerm from exiting non-zero if update-binfmts fails,
    for example if you're running something other than Linux
    (closes: #322193).
  * Policy version 3.6.2. No changes required.
  * Update GPL notices with the FSF's new address.

  [ Scott James Remnant ]
  * Use lsb functions in init script.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Tue, 30 Aug 2005 17:48:51 +0100

binfmt-support (1.2.4) hoary; urgency=low

  * Move binfmt-support to start at 90 rather than 20

 -- Thom May <thom@planetarytramp.net>  Fri, 10 Dec 2004 18:19:02 +0100

binfmt-support (1.2.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Convert binfmt-support(8) to the -mdoc macro set.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Thu,  1 Apr 2004 13:49:02 +0100

binfmt-support (1.2.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Document the 'detector' option in format files.
  * Don't bother trying to unload the binfmt_misc kernel module when
    stopping, since (a) it means we run into a kernel bug, (b) it means we
    have to keep track of whether the module was loaded by the administrator
    before starting, and (c) it's unimportant anyway. Reassigns #155570 to
    kernel.
  * Policy version 3.5.9: no changes required.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Sat, 26 Apr 2003 19:07:39 +0100

binfmt-support (1.2.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Cosmetic improvements to debian/rules.
  * Make update-binfmts(8) render properly under groff's utf8 device: in
    particular, use '\-' rather than '-' where a real dash is needed.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Mon, 24 Feb 2003 01:48:43 +0000

binfmt-support (1.2.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Support for userspace detectors, at the request of the Mono folks. See
    /usr/share/doc/binfmt-support/detectors for the rationale and design.

    This involved substantial rearrangements of the code, so we now have a
    couple of Perl modules in the Binfmt:: namespace. They don't have a
    published interface, so writing code using them directly is a bad idea.

  * Check that interpreters (and the new detectors) are executable.
  * Localize all filehandles.
  * Policy version 3.5.8: drop /usr/doc symlink.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Wed, 11 Dec 2002 13:46:12 +0000

binfmt-support (1.1.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Check (again - how did I lose this?) for the existence of $register, not
    $procdir, when deciding whether to try loading the kernel module
    (closes: #134206).

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Tue,  5 Mar 2002 21:37:32 +0000

binfmt-support (1.1.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * The "phone me if you want a bug fixed" release. :-)
  * Apply more careful logic to loading and mounting binfmt_misc on newer
    kernels (thanks, Daniel Silverstone; closes: #131236).
  * Remove emacs local variables from this changelog.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Sun,  3 Feb 2002 20:37:30 +0000

binfmt-support (1.1.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Recommend in README.Debian that packages using --import conflict with
    binfmt-support (<< 1.1.2).

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Sat, 26 Jan 2002 19:05:34 +0000

binfmt-support (1.1.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix thinko that meant some warnings weren't printed.
  * Make much more careful use of return codes throughout.
  * When deciding whether to load the binfmt_misc module, check for the
    existence of /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/register, not merely the
    directory. It seems that recent kernels can leave the directory hanging
    around even after the module is removed (closes: #129400, #129621).

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Sat, 19 Jan 2002 19:14:58 +0000

binfmt-support (1.1.1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Return non-fatally if binfmt_misc couldn't be loaded (see #129170).

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Mon, 14 Jan 2002 13:52:32 +0000

binfmt-support (1.1.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Implement an --import option to allow packages to install format files
    without depending on binfmt-support. All format files will be imported
    by binfmt-support when it's eventually installed (closes: #119694).
  * Update lots of documentation in line with this.
  * Install the directory /usr/share/binfmts for format files.
  * Don't attempt to load and unload the binfmt_misc kernel module in --test
    mode.

  * Use Text::Wrap rather than my own wrap() function.
  * General code cleanup.
  * get_binfmt() now returns a hash, not an array.
  * Apply better nroff style to the man page.
  * Policy version 3.5.6.
  * Perl policy version 1.20.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Sun,  6 Jan 2002 13:58:51 +0000

binfmt-support (1.0.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Check whether modprobe is available before using it (closes: #106090).

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Sat, 21 Jul 2001 17:18:10 +0100

binfmt-support (1.0.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Updated to policy version 3.5.2: no changes required.
  * Remove duplicate conffiles entry.

  * Support recent -ac kernels which require binfmt_misc to be mounted as a
    filesystem. For now, it seems neatest to mount it over
    /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc, but that may change (especially as it's not
    clear whether that directory will always exist).
  * If disabling all binary formats, also unmount the filesystem if
    necessary, and unload the kernel module. This will help upgrading in the
    future if the kernel interface is changed again.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Fri, 27 Apr 2001 11:58:01 +0100

binfmt-support (1.0.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Uploaded to Debian (closes: #78872).
  * New maintainer address.
  * Standards-Version: 3.5.1: no changes required.
  * Use debhelper v3.
  * Updated to new Perl policy.
  * This is Architecture: all, so use the binary-indep target in
    debian/rules rather than the binary-arch target.
  * Started updating the version number automagically.
  * Pointed URL in copyright file to the package pool.

  * --display can now be called without an argument to display all known
    binary formats and whether they are enabled; its output looks better,
    too.
  * Improved --test option.
  * Don't hardcode ENOENT any more, anticipating future Hurd support.
  * Print an error message on startup if the operating system isn't Linux
    (although the package can still be installed).
  * Recoded the option parsing and the actions into dispatch tables.
  * Really test for existence of /usr/sbin/update-binfmts in init script.
  * Fixed formatting error in man page (\x is an escape sequence).
  * "Debian GNU/Linux" -> "Debian GNU".

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Sat, 17 Feb 2001 14:38:55 +0000

binfmt-support (1.0.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * D'oh. update-binfmts should have been in /usr/sbin all along. Updated
    README.Debian to account for this.
  * Included the GPL in the source package.
  * Improved --install/--remove logic:
    - Remove entries even if their interpreter has changed, otherwise
      deliberately changing interpreters becomes rather awkward. We only
      need to make sure that the package is the same.
    - --install will now disable existing /proc entries as long as
      /var/lib/binfmts is consistent. Without this, you could sometimes end
      up with multiple entries in /proc with the same name, due to a kernel
      bug. Added some extra checking to make this even less likely.
    - Don't warn about there being no /proc entry when removing. This can
      easily happen on upgrades, and it also helps maintainer scripts to be
      idempotent.
  * Running --enable and/or --disable multiple times now doesn't create
    multiple entries in /proc with the same name either.

 -- Colin Watson <cjw44@flatline.org.uk>  Sun, 10 Dec 2000 00:24:18 +0000

binfmt-support (1.0.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Standards-Version: 3.2.1: no changes required.
  * Build-Depends-Indep: rather than Build-Depends:.
  * Use debhelper DH_COMPAT=2.
  * debian/rules: cleanup.
  * Don't 'use diagnostics'; it's slow.
  * Some additions to the man page.
  * Oops, remember to update $VERSION this time.
  * Added debian/TODO.
  * Added note in README.Debian about requiring binfmt_misc.

 -- Colin Watson <cjw44@flatline.org.uk>  Wed,  6 Dec 2000 00:45:44 +0000

binfmt-support (1.0.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Improved long description (sysadmins can use update-binfmts too).
  * Standards-Version: 3.1.1, Build-Depends: line.

 -- Colin Watson <cjw44@flatline.org.uk>  Tue, 30 May 2000 23:18:58 +0100

binfmt-support (1.0) unstable; urgency=low
